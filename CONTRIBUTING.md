## Start with the behaviour

Describe the user-visible problem, the smallest proposed change and the trade-off.
For a bug, include a reproduction and a regression test that fails before the fix.
Keep dependency upgrades separate from behaviour changes when possible.

## What matters in this repository

Accurate descriptions, current sample scope and a short reading path for reviewers. Link to executable evidence instead of unsupported performance claims.

## Verification

```text
Review each repository link and its current README.
```

This repository is a profile, not an application. There is no application test suite to run.

## Before opening a change

- Run the relevant checks and record the command and result in the pull request.
- Update examples and the README if setup, public behaviour or limitations change.
- Explain any data migration, compatibility impact and rollback approach.
- Add a short architecture decision when a boundary or operational guarantee changes.
- Include only synthetic fixtures and example configuration, with no customer records or credentials.

Follow `.editorconfig` and keep unrelated formatting changes out of the diff.
Dependency-update pull requests require review and verification; nothing is auto-merged.
